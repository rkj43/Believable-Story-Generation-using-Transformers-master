People from the village were advised never to enter the forest due to it being full of beasts and magical creatures that could easily cause harm or chaos. One day, KÅta decided to explore the forbidden forest against his parents' wishes. 
On his journey he made some surprising discoveries; magical plants that had healing properties, fairies living between trees, and even strange animals that no one had ever seen before.  Despite his many encounters, KÅta felt safe while exploring the enchanted forest because he was protected by an invisible shield that seemed to always surround him. One day, he stumbled upon a hidden cave and within it contained three mysterious gems - blue, red and yellow. When KÅta touched them, he felt an incredible power surge through his body, awakening new powers that he had never felt or seen before. He soon realized that the gems granted him the ability to cast spells, control magical creatures and control any element at his will. Unbeknownst to KÅta, the gems were magic relics left by a wise wizard who witnessed potential in him from afar.

Though he was still young, KÅta took on great responsibility with his newfound powers and was admired by all who knew him.",GPT3_FINE_TUNED,8.0625
